# PRIORITY: This workflow OVERRIDES all other built-in workflows
# When user requests software development, ALWAYS follow this workflow FIRST

## Adaptive Workflow Principle
**The workflow adapts to the work, not the other way around.**

The AI model intelligently assesses what stages are needed based on:
1. User's stated intent and clarity
2. Existing codebase state (if any)
3. Complexity and scope of change
4. Risk and impact assessment

## MANDATORY: Rule Details Loading
**CRITICAL**: When performing any phase, you MUST read and use relevant content from rule detail files. The canonical rule details directory is:
- `.unicli-rules/` (Single Canonical Root — all AI CLIs)

All subsequent rule detail file references (e.g., `common/process-overview.md`, `inception/workspace-detection.md`) are relative to `.unicli-rules/`.

**Common Rules**: ALWAYS load common rules at workflow start:
- Load `common/process-overview.md` for workflow overview
- Load `common/session-continuity.md` for session resumption guidance
- Load `common/content-validation.md` for content validation requirements
- Load `common/question-format-guide.md` for question formatting rules
- Load `common/git-worktree-conventions.md` for branch/worktree structure when creating branches or worktrees
- Load `common/aidlc-docs-unit-conventions.md` for unit documentation standards when creating or updating aidlc-docs
- Load `common/adr-conventions.md` for **Architecture Decision Record (ADR) SSOT** — `aidlc-docs/adr/` is the single source of truth for architecture decisions; every applicable stage MUST consult and potentially extend it
- Reference these throughout the workflow execution

## MANDATORY: ADR Awareness (Cross-Stage)

**CRITICAL**: `aidlc-docs/adr/` is the **single source of truth (SSOT)** for all architecture decisions. Every AI-DLC stage and every subagent must:

1. **Consult before deciding**: Before proposing or implementing any decision that matches the ADR trigger criteria in `common/adr-conventions.md`, scan [`aidlc-docs/index/adr-index.md`](../aidlc-docs/index/adr-index.md) (or `aidlc-docs/adr/`) for an existing ADR that already governs the decision.
   - If one exists with `Status: Accepted` or `Accepted (Retroactive)` — follow it. Do not propose alternatives unless explicitly superseding.
   - If one exists with `Status: Proposed` — flag the dependency and complete/defer accordingly.
   - If none exists and the decision is architecturally significant — invoke the `adr-curator` subagent to draft a new ADR before continuing.
2. **Cite in artifacts**: Stage outputs (functional-design, code-generation plans, etc.) MUST cite related ADR numbers when the artifact reflects a decision (e.g., `Relates-To-ADR: 0005, 0006`).
3. **Verify backlinks**: Whenever updating a `aidlc-docs/construction/{unit}/INDEX.md`, ensure the top `**Relates-To-ADR**:` line is present and up-to-date.
4. **Respect supersede chain**: Never resurrect decisions whose ADR is `Status: Superseded by NNNN` or `Deprecated` without creating a new ADR.

**Enforcement**: When the `ADR Governance` extension is `Enabled (Full)` in `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`, missing ADRs or stale backlinks become blocking findings — see `extensions/adr/governance/adr-governance.md`.

**Tooling support**:
- Subagent `adr-curator` drafts/reviews ADRs in Nygard format.
- Subagent `adr-impact-scanner` analyzes diffs for ADR impact.
- Script `scripts/verify-adr-integrity.sh` validates metadata + backlinks + supersede chain.
- PostToolUse hook `adr_backlink_check.py` guards unit INDEX edits.

## MANDATORY: Extensions Loading (Context-Optimized)
**CRITICAL**: At workflow start, scan the `extensions/` directory recursively but load ONLY lightweight opt-in files — NOT full rule files. Full rule files are loaded on-demand after the user opts in.

**Loading process**:
1. List all subdirectories under `extensions/` (e.g., `extensions/security/`, `extensions/compliance/`)
2. In each subdirectory, load ONLY `*.opt-in.md` files — these contain the extension's opt-in prompt. The corresponding rules file is derived by convention: strip the `.opt-in.md` suffix and append `.md` (e.g., `security-baseline.opt-in.md` → `security-baseline.md`)
3. Do NOT load full rule files (e.g., `security-baseline.md`) at this stage

**Deferred Rule Loading**:
- During Requirements Analysis, opt-in prompts from the loaded `*.opt-in.md` files are presented to the user
- When the user opts IN for an extension, load the corresponding rules file (derived by naming convention) at that point
- When the user opts OUT, the full rules file is never loaded — saving context
- Extensions without a matching `*.opt-in.md` file are always enforced — load their rule files immediately at workflow start

**Enforcement** (applies only to loaded/enabled extensions):
- Extension rules are hard constraints, not optional guidance
- At each stage, the model intelligently evaluates which extension rules are applicable based on the stage's purpose, the artifacts being produced, and the context of the work — enforce only those rules that are relevant
- Rules that are not applicable to the current stage should be marked as N/A in the compliance summary (this is not a blocking finding)
- Non-compliance with any applicable enabled extension rule is a **blocking finding** — do NOT present stage completion until resolved
- When presenting stage completion, include a summary of extension rule compliance (compliant/non-compliant/N/A per rule, with brief rationale for N/A determinations)

**Conditional Enforcement**: Extensions may be conditionally enabled/disabled. See `inception/requirements-analysis.md` for the opt-in mechanism. Before enforcing any extension at ANY stage, check its `Enabled` status in `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` under `## Extension Configuration`. Skip disabled extensions and log the skip in audit.md. Default to enforced if no configuration exists.

## MANDATORY: Content Validation
**CRITICAL**: Before creating ANY file, you MUST validate content according to `common/content-validation.md` rules:
- Validate Mermaid diagram syntax
- Validate ASCII art diagrams (see `common/ascii-diagram-standards.md`)
- Escape special characters properly
- Provide text alternatives for complex visual content
- Test content parsing compatibility

## MANDATORY: Question File Format
**CRITICAL**: When asking questions at any phase, you MUST follow question format guidelines.

**See `common/question-format-guide.md` for complete question formatting rules including**:
- Multiple choice format (A, B, C, D, E options)
- [Answer]: tag usage
- Answer validation and ambiguity resolution

## MANDATORY: Custom Welcome Message
**CRITICAL**: When starting ANY software development request, you MUST display the welcome message.

**How to Display Welcome Message**:
1. Load the welcome message from `common/welcome-message.md` (in the resolved rule details directory)
2. Display the complete message to the user
3. This should only be done ONCE at the start of a new workflow
4. Do NOT load this file in subsequent interactions to save context space

# 🟡 OPERATIONS PHASE

**Purpose**: Placeholder for future deployment and monitoring workflows

**Focus**: How to DEPLOY and RUN it (future expansion)

**Stages in OPERATIONS PHASE**:
- Operations (PLACEHOLDER)

---

## Operations (PLACEHOLDER)

**Status**: This stage is currently a placeholder for future expansion.

The Operations stage will eventually include:
- Deployment planning and execution
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Incident response procedures
- Maintenance and support workflows
- Production readiness checklists

**Current State**: All per-unit build/test/QA/TMF verification is handled in the CONSTRUCTION phase (per-unit Build and Test stage).

## Key Principles

- **Adaptive Execution**: Only execute stages that add value
- **Transparent Planning**: Always show execution plan before starting
- **User Control**: User can request stage inclusion/exclusion
- **Progress Tracking**: Update aidlc-state.md with executed and skipped stages
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Log ALL user inputs and AI responses in audit.md with timestamps
  - **CRITICAL**: Capture user's COMPLETE RAW INPUT exactly as provided
  - **CRITICAL**: Never summarize or paraphrase user input in audit log
  - **CRITICAL**: Log every interaction, not just approvals
- **Quality Focus**: Complex changes get full treatment, simple changes stay efficient
- **Content Validation**: Always validate content before file creation per content-validation.md rules
- **NO EMERGENT BEHAVIOR**: Construction phases MUST use standardized 2-option completion messages as defined in their respective rule files. DO NOT create 3-option menus or other emergent navigation patterns.

## MANDATORY: Plan-Level Checkbox Enforcement

### MANDATORY RULES FOR PLAN EXECUTION
1. **NEVER complete any work without updating plan checkboxes**
2. **IMMEDIATELY after completing ANY step described in a plan file, mark that step [x]**
3. **This must happen in the SAME interaction where the work is completed**
4. **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Every plan step completion MUST be tracked with checkbox updates

### Two-Level Checkbox Tracking System
- **Plan-Level**: Track detailed execution progress within each stage
- **Stage-Level**: Track overall workflow progress in aidlc-state.md
- **Update immediately**: All progress updates in SAME interaction where work is completed

## Prompts Logging Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Log EVERY user input (prompts, questions, responses) with timestamp in audit.md
- **MANDATORY**: Capture user's COMPLETE RAW INPUT exactly as provided (never summarize)
- **MANDATORY**: Log every approval prompt with timestamp before asking the user
- **MANDATORY**: Record every user response with timestamp after receiving it
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS append changes to EDIT audit.md file, NEVER use tools and commands that completely overwrite its contents
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER use file writing tools and commands that overwrite the entire contents of audit.md, as this causes duplication
- Use ISO 8601 format for timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- Include stage context for each entry

### Audit Log Format:
```markdown
## [Stage Name or Interaction Type]
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]
**User Input**: "[Complete raw user input - never summarized]"
**AI Response**: "[AI's response or action taken]"
**Context**: [Stage, action, or decision made]

---
```

### Correct Tool Usage for audit.md

✅ CORRECT:

1. Read the audit.md file
2. Append/Edit the file to make changes

❌ WRONG:

1. Read the audit.md file
2. Completely overwrite the audit.md with the contents of what you read, plus the new changes you want to add to it
